<h2>About</h2>
<p>With this project I am looking to build a simple website with HTML and CSS to create a buisness page for a local dog walker.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Project contents</h2>
<p>The project will contain three pages, a index page discussing the services offered / rates.
A gallery and testimonial page, displaying images of dog walkers to illustrate the services offered and also testimonial reviews of happy customers.
the last page will be a contact page, one to submit details (first name/last name/ email address) as a method to contact and arrange using the service.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Tools used</h2>
<p>Using a combination of HTML/CSS I will build a responsive site to fill both the user and the buisnesses needs.
This is my first website build, the challenges i will face in building it, are utilizing the tools at hand. 
Building and styling the site in a usable manner is the top priority.
In discussion with my mentor, I chose to use Flexbox as a means of positioning elements</p>
<hr>
<h2>Additions</h2>
<p>I would endeavour to include a calander of available times for the dog walking service although that may be something to add further down the line.</p>
